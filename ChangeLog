	field to print when (s)he finished (or how many days passed).

	removed from charcters for symbolic names.

	* gmc/mySupport.ml (Pervasives.pos): New function. pos a l returns
	the position of a in l.  If a is not in l, it raises Not_found.
	The first element is 1.

2008-05-29  Atsushi Igarashi  <igarashi@localhost>

	* ML6: new game for ML6 (pattern matching).
	* test.sh: new cases for ML6.

	* gmc/mySupport.ml (Pervasives.iteri): New function.  Iteration
	over a list with index (the first element is indexed by 1).
	
	* ML5/pp.ml (print_exp): Recovering missing parens for cons.
	* TypingML5/pp.ml (print_exp): Ditto.

	* gmc/emit.ml (emit_exp_of_premises): If a side condition of the
	form `$o = ...` contains a fresh metavariable $o, 'let $o = ...'
	is generated.  $o will be compared with other, later occurrences
	of the same variable.

2008-05-28  Atsushi Igarashi  <igarashi@localhost>

	* gmc/emit.ml (emit_pat_of_derivs): Side conditions are also given
	their own index numbers (but not printed in the pattern).  This
	will allow some metavars in side conditions to appear as declaration
	in the emitted code.
	
	* gmc/{syntax.ml, syntax.mli, parser.mly, lexer.mll, main.ml}: .gm
	  file now allows ML code at the end of the file with the tag
	  "[ML]".  The code will be inserted before generated functions so
	  that they can be referred to by rules of the game.

2008-05-18  Atsushi Igarashi  <igarashi@localhost>

	* checker/TypingML5: new game for typing ML5 expressions.  ML
	files other than core.ml are generated, as done for TypingML5, by

	pretty-printing functions.

	* checker/{ML2,ML3,ML4}/pp.ml: Small bug fix.

	* checker/main.ml: A small adjustment of the usage message.

	* checker/TypingML4: Fixed a bug in T-LetRec.

	premises share some output variables or one premise has multiple
	occurrences of the same variable.

	* checker/TypingML2: new game for typing ML2 expressions.
	
	* gmc/emit.ml: newline at the final line for the emitted program.

	* gmc/mode.ml: New module for mode analysis.
	* gmc/main.ml, gmc/mySupport.ml, gmc/syntax.ml, gmc/syntax.mli: 
	changes to incorporate mode analysis.

2008-04-19  Atsushi Igarashi  <igarashi@cornet>

	* checker/ML?/{ML2.gm, parser.mly, pp.ml}: primitive type bool is
	used for boolean values and expressions.

	* checker/ML3: implemented.
	* checker/*/parser.mly: better handling	of unary minus

2008-04-04  Atsushi Igarashi  <igarashi@cornet>

	* gmc/emit.ml: (More) proper handling of quoted ML expressions in
	rules.  Specifically, the form `$o = (boolexp)` will be converted
	to let-binding whereas the form `(boolexp)` (without $o-type
	variables) will be to the expression verbatim.  See doc/main.tex,
	too.

	* examples/ML2.gm: representation of env is modified.
	* examples/ML2/{parser.mly, pp.ml}: according changes.
	
	* examples/common/main.ml: if file name is omitted, it reads from
	stdin. 
	
2008-04-03  Atsushi Igarashi  <igarashi@cornet>

	* gmc/emit.ml: All calls of Format.printf has been replaced with
	Format.fprintf.

	should be added.)
	* gmc/lexer.mll: line counting inside comments.
	* gmc/main.ml: now knows the input file name.

	* examples/common/lexer.mll: "?" and ";" are now scanned as
	symbolic keywords.  So, for example, "??" can be a single token in
	some game.  Now, only special characters are parens and braces.

	Names consisting only of lowercase characters are now categorized
	as a token LCID.  The parser of each game should allow both LCIDs
	and alphabetical names (ID) as a rule name.

	* examples/common/link.ml: function lcid() added.
	
	* examples/*/keywords.ml: "?" and ";" are listed as keywords.

2008-03-31  Atsushi Igarashi  <igarashi@cornet>

	* examples/ML1/pp.ml, examples/nat/pp.ml, examples/common/link.ml:
	error handling in derivation search.
	* examples/common/Makefile: better dependency descrpition.

	* gmc/emit.ml, gmc/emit.mli, gmc/main.ml: now partly use
	Format.fprintf.  Should use it consistently.  Needs further
	tidying up.

	* examples/common/{main.ml, link.ml}: support of prover with -prove
	option. (combination with -full and -TeX options not supported
	yet.)

	incomplete.

	* source code restructuring: lexer is functorized.  Modules
	for each game are packed in to one module.  Switch to choose a game.

	* examples/common/syntax.ml, examples/nat/pp.ml: function to
	output derivations in TeX (-TeX flag).  

2008-03-22  Atsushi Igarashi  <igarashi@cornet>

	* gmc/emit.ml: function to format rules in TeX.

2008-03-21  IGARASHI Atsushi  <igarashi@sato.kuis.kyoto-u.ac.jp>

	* examples/common/main.ml: checker now takes more than one derivation.
